# Contributing to Peykan

Thanks for taking a look. This project is intentionally small and educational —
keep contributions in that spirit: prefer clarity over cleverness, and reuse
the existing patterns (see `src/peykan/`'s layout) rather than introducing
new ones for a one-off feature.

## Local setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate   # or `source .venv/bin/activate` on Linux/macOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
pip install pytest ruff mypy
```

Windows note: if your checkout lives under a cloud-synced folder (OneDrive,
Dropbox, etc.) and `pip install -e .` or `git` commands fail with odd
`FileNotFoundError`/`Permission denied` errors on file creation, that's the
sync client interfering with the filesystem — try pausing sync for that
folder or working from a local (non-synced) path.

## Before opening a PR

```bash
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest -q
```

All three must pass — this mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exactly
(Python 3.10 and 3.11). If you add a new module, keep `mypy`'s zero-error bar:
this codebase deliberately keeps `strict`-ish settings clean rather than
suppressing errors with blanket `# type: ignore`s.

For a live sanity check beyond the test suite, run the actual server and
call a tool through a real MCP client:

```bash
peykan demo --port 6278
```

then, in another shell, use the MCP Inspector (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`,
connect to `http://localhost:6278/sse`) or a small script with
`mcp.client.sse.sse_client` / `ClientSession` to call a tool end-to-end.
Unit tests mock the CAN bus (see `tests/test_cli.py`'s `FakeBus`); nothing in
the suite starts a real server or virtual bus, so this manual pass is the
only thing that catches wiring/transport-level regressions.

## Code layout

- `src/peykan/bus.py`, `dbc.py`, `obd.py`, `diagnostics.py`, `j1939.py`,
  `uds.py`, `logs.py` — protocol/bus logic, no MCP or CLI awareness. New protocol behavior belongs
  here, not in `server/` or `cli.py`. `j1939.py` is deliberately *not*
  DBC-driven (J1939 rides 29-bit extended IDs whose arbitration field is
  structured data); its simulator side lives in
  `simulator/j1939_runner.py`.
- `src/peykan/safety.py` — the transmit policy. Anything that sends on the
  bus must go through `TransmitGuard.wrap(bus, purpose, write=...)`, with
  `write=True` for anything that changes ECU or bus state; never call a raw
  bus's `send` from a tool or CLI command.
- `src/peykan/server/mcp_server.py` — MCP tool/resource definitions;
  `server/schemas.py` — the Pydantic models those tools return;
  `server/live_state.py` — the single background listener backing both the
  passive-listening tools (`read_can_frames`/`filter_frames`/`monitor_signal`)
  and the `/dashboard` SSE stream. Passive tools should query
  `live_state.frames_since(...)`, not open their own bus connection — that
  used to be a real reliability bug (frames dropped between calls, or stolen
  by a competing listener on the same bus instance). Request/response tools
  (`send_obd_request`, `send_diagnostic_request`) are the exception: they
  genuinely need to send something and wait for a specific reply, so they
  still open their own short-lived `make_bus()` instance.
- `src/peykan/simulator/runner.py` — the ECU simulator threads
  (`SimThread`, `OBDResponderThread`, `DiagnosticResponderThread`), plus
  `j1939_runner.py`'s J1939 broadcasters/responders started from
  `run_simulator()` when `PEYKAN_J1939_ENABLED`. Each
  bus *listener* thread needs its **own** `make_bus(...)` instance — a
  single `python-can` `Bus` instance's `recv()` queue is consumed once per
  message, so two threads sharing one instance will silently steal frames
  from each other instead of each seeing every frame. (This was a real bug
  caught while adding the diagnostic responder — see `run_simulator()`'s
  comment.)
- `src/peykan/cli.py` — the `peykan` Typer CLI; mirrors the MCP tool
  surface where practical so both interfaces stay in sync.

## Adding a new MCP tool

1. Add the protocol logic (encode/decode/whatever) to a plain module first —
   testable without any bus or MCP machinery.
2. Add a Pydantic return model to `server/schemas.py`.
3. Register the tool in `server/mcp_server.py::create_app()`. If it's
   passively watching traffic, read from `live_state.frames_since(...)`
   (see `read_can_frames` for the pattern) rather than opening a bus
   connection. If it sends something and waits for a specific reply, open
   its own bus with `make_bus()` and always `shutdown_bus()` in a `finally`
   (see `send_obd_request`). Either way, cap any `duration_s`/`timeout_s`
   against `settings.max_duration_s`.
4. If the CLI should expose the same capability, mirror it as a Typer
   command in `cli.py`.
5. Add a test: pure-logic tests belong next to the module they test (see
   `tests/test_diagnostics.py`, `tests/test_obd.py`); if the tool touches
   the bus, prefer a `FakeBus`-style unit test (see `tests/test_cli.py`)
   over spinning up a real server in the suite.

## The web app (`web/`)

[peykan.ai](https://peykan.ai) lives in `web/`: a Cloudflare Worker (TypeScript) with a chat agent, a per-visitor vehicle container built from this repo's `Dockerfile`, and a React UI. It's independent of the Python package's release cycle; see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for the architecture, limits and deployment.

```bash
cd web
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars       # Turnstile test keys + a session secret
npx wrangler login                   # the chat model runs on Workers AI, even in dev
peykan demo --transport streamable-http --port 6401   # in another terminal: the car
npm run dev
```

Containers can't run in local development on Windows, so dev uses the Peykan you start yourself (`VEHICLE_DEV_URL` in `.dev.vars`); deployed, each visitor gets their own container.

Before a PR touching `web/`, run what CI runs: `npx tsc --noEmit -p .`, `npx oxlint src/` and `npx vite build`. Never commit `.dev.vars` or real secrets: production secrets are set with `npx wrangler secret put`.

## Releasing to PyPI

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds and publishes on any `v*.*.*` tag
push, via `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`. As of this writing that workflow
has never been triggered (no tags/releases exist yet, and the package isn't
on PyPI) — before using it for the first time, confirm a `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
repository secret is configured, then:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## Reporting issues

Open a GitHub issue. Include your OS, Python version, and — if it's a CAN/MCP
issue — whether you're using the virtual backend or real hardware
(`PEYKAN_CAN_INTERFACE`).
