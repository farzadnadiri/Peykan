# 🚗 MCP-CAN: Vehicle CAN Bus, OBD-II and J1939 Diagnostics for LLMs (Model Context Protocol)

🔌 Virtual CAN + MCP Server

**MCP-CAN** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that exposes automotive **CAN bus**, **OBD-II** (SAE J1979), **UDS**, and **SAE J1939** diagnostic data to LLMs and AI agents. It ships a built-in **virtual CAN bus** with an **ECU simulator**, decodes traffic via a **DBC** database (`cantools`), and serves MCP tools over SSE or streamable-HTTP. No CAN hardware, adapter, or vehicle is required by default; optional SocketCAN/vCAN on Linux.

Use it to let an LLM read live CAN frames, decode signals, run OBD-II PID and UDS diagnostic requests, inspect J1939 PGNs/SPNs and DM1 trouble codes, and drive fault-injection scenarios, all against a simulated vehicle.

## ✨ Highlights
- MCP server for CAN/OBD/UDS-diagnostics/J1939 → LLM/SLM (tools + DBC metadata, SSE or streamable-HTTP).
- Virtual CAN backend (python-can) out of the box; optional SocketCAN/vCAN on Linux.
- DBC-driven encoding/decoding via `cantools`.
- ECU simulator that streams multiple messages, plus OBD-II, UDS-style, and SAE J1939 responders.
- SAE J1939 (heavy-duty, 29-bit extended IDs): ID decomposition (priority/PGN/source+destination address), a curated PGN/SPN catalog (EEC1, EEC2, ET1, CCVS1, LFE1, DD1), Request PGN (`0xEA00`) round trips, and DM1 active-DTC (SPN/FMI) broadcasts. Runs alongside the 11-bit bus; toggle with `MCP_CAN_J1939_ENABLED`.
- Correlated driving-dynamics signal generation, plus named fault-injection scenarios (`overheat`, `abs_fault`, `low_fuel`) with matching DTCs.
- Typer CLI: `mcp-can` (simulate, server, demo, frames, decode, monitor, dbc-info, obd-request, diag-request, fault, j1939-decode, j1939-pgns, j1939-request, j1939-dtcs).
- Structured tool output (typed Pydantic models), duration-capped tool calls, `/healthz`, colorized logging.
- Read-only live web dashboard (`/dashboard`): signal values and recent frames, updated over SSE.
- Dockerfile + docker compose for server + simulator.
- Unit tests, type hints, lint config (ruff, mypy); see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- Python 3.10+
- (Optional) Docker / Docker Compose
- (Optional) Ollama if you want a local LLM backend

## 📦 Install (Python)
From [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-can/):
```bash
pip install mcp-can
mcp-can demo          # simulator + MCP server in one process, no hardware needed
```
Or run it without installing into your environment: `pipx run mcp-can demo` / `uvx mcp-can demo`.

The sample `vehicle.dbc` ships inside the package, so this works from any directory; point `MCP_CAN_DBC_PATH` at your own DBC to use it instead.

From a checkout (for development):
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## 🚀 Quickstart (Simulator + MCP Server)
Two terminals:
```bash
# Terminal A: start ECU simulator on virtual bus0
mcp-can simulate

# Terminal B: start MCP server (SSE on 6278)
mcp-can server --port 6278
```

Single-process (helps on Windows if virtual backend doesn't share across processes):
```bash
mcp-can demo --port 6278
```

Sample interactions:
```bash
mcp-can frames --seconds 2
mcp-can decode 0x100 "01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08"       # pretty table by default, --json for scripting
mcp-can dbc-info                                      # table of every message/signal in the DBC
mcp-can monitor ENGINE_SPEED --seconds 3
mcp-can obd-request --service 0x01 --pid 0x0D
mcp-can diag-request --service-id 0x22 --parameter-id 0x05   # READ_DATA_BY_ID
mcp-can j1939-pgns                                            # J1939 PGN/SPN catalog
mcp-can j1939-request 0xF004                                  # ask ECUs to send EEC1 (engine speed)
mcp-can j1939-dtcs                                            # read the latest DM1 active-DTC broadcast
```

## 📊 Live Dashboard
With `mcp-can demo` (or `server`) running, open `http://localhost:6278/dashboard` in a browser: live signal values grouped by ECU message, and a scrolling feed of recent frames, updating ~2x/second over Server-Sent Events. It's read-only (view only, no controls to send frames) and self-contained: no build step, no external assets, works offline. Like everything bus-related here, it only shows data when the simulator shares the *same process* as the server (`mcp-can demo`); pointed at a bare `mcp-can server` with no simulator, it just shows "waiting for CAN traffic."

## 🛠️ Available MCP Tools & Resources
| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `read_can_frames` | tool | Raw frames from the last `duration_s` seconds. Returns instantly (served from a continuously-running history buffer, not a fresh listen window). |
| `decode_can_frame` | tool | Decode one frame's bytes into named signals. |
| `filter_frames` | tool | Like `read_can_frames`, filtered by arbitration ID and/or signal. |
| `monitor_signal` | tool | Timestamped samples of one decoded signal, from the same history buffer. |
| `get_vehicle_snapshot` | tool | Last known value of every signal seen so far, one entry per signal (not per frame) with an `age_s` freshness indicator: a single-call overview instead of decoding a frame stream yourself. |
| `send_obd_request` | tool | Standard OBD-II (SAE J1979) request; decodes known PIDs (coolant temp, speed, fuel level, fuel type). |
| `send_diagnostic_request` | tool | UDS-style diagnostic request (`vehicle.dbc`'s `DIAGNOSTIC_REQUEST`); collects every ECU's response. |
| `activate_fault_scenario` | tool | Activate (or clear) a named fault-injection preset (`overheat`, `abs_fault`, `low_fuel`) in the running simulator; see below. |
| `decode_j1939_frame` | tool | Decompose a 29-bit J1939 ID (priority / PGN / source + destination address) and decode known SPNs from the payload. |
| `list_j1939_pgns` | tool | The J1939 PGN/SPN catalog this server can decode and request (bit layout, scaling, units). |
| `request_j1939_pgn` | tool | Send a J1939 Request PGN (`0xEA00`) and return the decoded responses (needs a simulator on this process's bus). |
| `read_j1939_dtcs` | tool | Most recent J1939 DM1 broadcast: lamp status plus every active SPN/FMI. Served from the frame history buffer. |
| `dbc_info` | resource (`file://vehicle.dbc`) | Full DBC dump: nodes, messages, signals. |

`read_can_frames`/`filter_frames`/`monitor_signal`/`read_j1939_dtcs` are served from a single continuously-running history buffer (`server/live_state.py`) rather than each opening its own bus listener: they return immediately and won't miss frames sent between calls. `send_obd_request`/`send_diagnostic_request`/`request_j1939_pgn` are request/response and still wait live for a reply. In both cases, `duration_s`/`timeout_s` is capped by `MCP_CAN_MAX_DURATION_S` (default 30s; the history buffer retains at least that much, or 60s, whichever is larger). All tools return typed, structured content (see `server/schemas.py`) rather than ad-hoc JSON.

### 🩺 About the diagnostic responder
`vehicle.dbc` defines a UDS-like diagnostic schema: `DIAGNOSTIC_REQUEST` (one shared request frame) and four `DIAGNOSTIC_RESPONSE_<ECU>` messages, one per ECU, but the request has no per-ECU target field. The simulator treats every request as functionally addressed to *all four* ECUs, so `send_diagnostic_request`/`diag-request` may return more than one response. Supported services: `START_DIAGNOSTIC_SESSION` (0x10) and `RESET_ECU` (0x11) are acknowledged OK; `READ_DATA_BY_ID` (0x22) returns a deterministic canned value derived from the parameter ID; `ROUTINE_CONTROL`/`READ_MEMORY`/`WRITE_MEMORY` and anything unrecognized return `SERVICE_NOT_SUPPORTED`; see `diagnostics.py::handle_service`.

### ⚠️ Fault injection
Three named scenarios (`simulator/faults.py::PRESETS`) let you force the simulator into a specific fault state instead of waiting on random signal generation:
- `overheat` – `ENGINE_TEMP` pinned to its hottest reportable value, `SYSTEM_STATUS` set to `FAULT_PRESENT`, DTC `P0217` (Engine Overtemp Condition).
- `abs_fault` – all four `WHEEL_SPEED_*` signals stuck at zero, `SYSTEM_STATUS` set to `FAULT_PRESENT`, DTC `C0035` (Left Front Wheel Speed Sensor Circuit).
- `low_fuel` – `FUEL_LEVEL` pinned critically low; no DTC (a low-fuel light isn't a stored trouble code on a real vehicle either).

Activating a scenario sends a small control frame on the bus (like OBD/diagnostic requests, this is a round trip to whichever process is running the simulator, so it needs `mcp-can demo`/`simulate` already running) and overrides the named signals until cleared. Any DTCs the active scenario sets show up in `send_obd_request`/`obd-request`'s Mode 03 (service=3) response. Use `mcp-can fault list` or the `activate_fault_scenario` tool's docstring to see the current preset descriptions; pass `preset=None` (CLI: `clear`) to deactivate.

### 🚛 SAE J1939 (heavy-duty)
Alongside the light-vehicle 11-bit bus, the simulator also speaks **SAE J1939** — the protocol on trucks, buses and off-highway equipment. J1939 rides 29-bit *extended* CAN IDs whose arbitration field is itself structured data: a 3-bit priority, an 18-bit Parameter Group Number (PGN), and an 8-bit source address (plus, for peer-to-peer "PDU1" PGNs, a destination address). `src/mcp_can/j1939.py` is a self-contained implementation of that layer (not DBC-driven — `vehicle.dbc` models an 11-bit light-vehicle bus).

What's simulated (`simulator/j1939_runner.py`), driven by the same correlated driving-dynamics state as the 11-bit signals:

| PGN | Acronym | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `0xF004` | EEC1 | Engine speed (SPN 190), actual engine percent torque (SPN 513) |
| `0xF003` | EEC2 | Accelerator pedal position (SPN 91), percent load (SPN 92) |
| `0xFEEE` | ET1 | Engine coolant temperature (SPN 110), fuel temperature (SPN 174) |
| `0xFEF1` | CCVS1 | Wheel-based vehicle speed (SPN 84) |
| `0xFEF2` | LFE1 | Engine fuel rate (SPN 183), throttle valve position (SPN 51) |
| `0xFEFC` | DD1 | Fuel level (SPN 96) |
| `0xFECA` | DM1 | Active diagnostic trouble codes (SPN + FMI), broadcast at 1 Hz |

- **Request PGN (`0xEA00`):** `request_j1939_pgn` / `mcp-can j1939-request <pgn>` send a request; the simulator re-broadcasts the requested PGN once.
- **DM1 / DTCs:** `read_j1939_dtcs` / `mcp-can j1939-dtcs` read the latest DM1. The fault-injection presets map to J1939 DTCs too — `overheat` → SPN 110 FMI 0, `abs_fault` → SPN 84 FMI 5, `low_fuel` → SPN 96 FMI 18 — and the malfunction-indicator lamp turns on while a preset is active.
- J1939 signals also appear in `get_vehicle_snapshot` and the dashboard, grouped under `J1939:<acronym>`.
- Set `MCP_CAN_J1939_ENABLED=false` for an 11-bit-only bus.

## 🔍 MCP Inspector (GUI for your tools)
Use the official Inspector to explore and call your MCP tools without writing a host:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```
When prompted, connect to your server:
- URL: `http://localhost:6278/sse`

You can then list tools/resources and call one (e.g. monitor `ENGINE_SPEED` for 5 seconds) and view structured output live.

## 🤖 Using with Ollama (local LLM)
Ollama runs the model but can't connect to MCP servers on its own, so you need a small client in between. [`ollmcp`](https://github.com/jonigl/mcp-client-for-ollama) is the quickest option.

1. Pull a model that supports **tool calling** and fits in your GPU's memory, e.g. `ollama pull qwen3:8b` (about 5 GB). To check a model, run `ollama show <model>` and look for `tools` under *Capabilities*. Models without it (e.g. the original `llama3`) can chat but can't call the CAN tools.
2. Terminal A: start the simulator and server:
   ```bash
   mcp-can demo
   ```
3. Terminal B: install `ollmcp` in **its own virtual environment** and connect it. It needs the `mcp` 2.x SDK while `mcp-can` currently needs 1.x, so installing both into one Python breaks one of them. They only talk over HTTP, so separate environments work fine.
   ```bash
   python -m venv ollmcp-env
   ollmcp-env/bin/pip install ollmcp          # Windows: ollmcp-env\Scripts\pip install ollmcp
   ollmcp-env/bin/ollmcp -u http://localhost:6278/sse -m qwen3:8b
   ```
   (`pipx install ollmcp` or `uv tool install ollmcp` do the same in one step.) `ollmcp` should list the 12 MCP-CAN tools on startup.
4. In the `ollmcp` chat, run these once (commands start with `/`):
   - `/tm` turns thinking mode off. With thinking on, answers take 20–60 s and `ollmcp` sometimes drops the tool call after thinking ("No Response from Model"). With it off, answers take a few seconds.
   - `/hil` stops the confirmation prompt before every tool call.
5. Ask questions in plain language. The chat talks to the model; it isn't a shell.
   - "What's the latest vehicle speed?"
   - "What's the engine speed and coolant temperature right now?"
   - "Read the OBD-II trouble codes."
   - "Activate the overheat fault, then read the J1939 DTCs."

Troubleshooting:
- **Stuck on "working..." or very slow:** check where the model runs with `ollama ps` while it answers. On laptops with both integrated and dedicated graphics, Ollama may choose the integrated GPU (it borrows system RAM, so it looks large), which is many times slower. Set `OLLAMA_VULKAN=0` to keep it on an NVIDIA GPU, and `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=8192` so the model fits in the GPU's memory. Then fully restart Ollama (on Windows, *Quit* from the tray icon and relaunch). On Windows: `setx OLLAMA_VULKAN 0` and `setx OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH 8192`.
- **Wrong tool or wrong IDs:** small models sometimes pick a roundabout tool. Name it ("use get_vehicle_snapshot"), or clear the context with `/cc`. Tools that take IDs (PGNs, CAN IDs, OBD PIDs, UDS services) accept hex strings like `"0xF004"` and J1939 acronyms like `"EEC1"`, so models don't have to convert hex to decimal (a common source of wrong requests).
- Watch the same signals live at `http://localhost:6278` while you chat.

Other MCP hosts work too: [Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/) can use Ollama models with MCP tools, and VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf and Claude Desktop can connect to `http://localhost:6278/sse` directly, using their own models.

## ⌨️ CLI Reference
- `mcp-can simulate` – start ECU simulator using the configured DBC (bundled `vehicle.dbc` by default).
- `mcp-can server [--port 6278] [--transport sse|streamable-http|stdio]` – run the MCP server.
- `mcp-can demo [--port] [--transport]` – simulator + server in one process.
- `mcp-can frames --seconds 1.0` – capture raw frames as JSON.
- `mcp-can decode <id> <data> [--json]` – decode a single frame (table by default; `id` hex/decimal, `data` space/comma-separated bytes).
- `mcp-can snapshot --seconds 1.0 [--json]` – latest value of every signal seen while listening.
- `mcp-can dbc-info [message]` – table of every message/signal in the DBC, or just one message's.
- `mcp-can monitor <signal> --seconds 2.0 [--json]` – watch one signal (live output by default).
- `mcp-can obd-request --service <hex|int> [--pid <hex|int>]` – OBD-II request; response includes a decoded value for known PIDs.
- `mcp-can diag-request --service-id <hex|int> [--parameter-id] [--data-field]` – UDS-style diagnostic request; prints every ECU's response.
- `mcp-can fault <preset|clear|list>` – activate/clear a fault-injection scenario in a running simulator, or list available presets.
- `mcp-can j1939-decode <id> <data> [--json]` – decompose a 29-bit J1939 ID and decode known SPNs.

- `mcp-can j1939-request <pgn> [--timeout 2.0]` – send a J1939 Request PGN (`0xEA00`) and print decoded responses; `pgn` can be an acronym (`EEC1`), hex (`0xF004`) or decimal.
- `mcp-can j1939-dtcs [--seconds 3.0]` – listen for a J1939 DM1 broadcast and print its active trouble codes.

`server`/`demo`/`simulate` all print colorized logs (via `rich`) instead of raw text.

## ⚙️ Configuration
Env vars (prefix `MCP_CAN_`):
- `CAN_INTERFACE` (default `virtual`)
- `CAN_CHANNEL` (default `bus0`)
- `DBC_PATH` (default: the `vehicle.dbc` bundled with the package)
- `MCP_PORT` (default `6278`)
- `MCP_TRANSPORT` (default `sse`; `streamable-http` requires a newer `mcp` SDK; the server logs a clear error and exits if the installed version doesn't support it, rather than crashing on an SDK traceback)
- `MAX_DURATION_S` (default `30.0`) – caps every tool's `duration_s`/`timeout_s`
- `J1939_ENABLED` (default `true`) – run the SAE J1939 side of the simulator alongside the 11-bit signals
- `LOG_LEVEL` (default `INFO`)
- `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` (default `["*"]`, JSON array e.g. `["https://your-host.example"]`) – allowed browser origins for the SSE endpoint. Credentialed requests (`allow_credentials`) are only enabled once this is narrowed to specific origins; wildcard + credentials is a combination browsers reject outright, so it's never turned on for the default `"*"`. Override before any real deployment.

You can also set these in a `.env` file in the working directory.

## 🐳 Docker
Build:
```bash
docker build -t mcp-can .
```
Run (combined server + simulator):
```bash
docker run -d --name mcp-can -p 6278:6278 -p 5000:5000 -p 8080:8080 mcp-can
```
Compose (from `docker/`):
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
> The compose file currently runs `server` and `simulator` as separate containers; like running them as two separate local processes, they won't share the virtual CAN bus unless the host provides a real shared `vcan0` interface. For a working combined setup today, use the single-container Dockerfile above (`mcp-can demo`).

## 🧪 Development & Testing
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full guide. Quick version:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"

ruff check .
mypy src
pytest -q
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- No frames? Ensure both simulator and server use the same interface/channel (`virtual`/`bus0` by default), and, on Windows, that they're the same process (`mcp-can demo`) rather than two separate ones.
- DBC missing? Unset `MCP_CAN_DBC_PATH` to fall back to the bundled sample, or point it at an existing `.dbc` file.
- Docker networking: expose `6278` so your MCP host can reach it.
- `streamable-http` transport fails immediately? Your installed `mcp` package predates its support; the log line tells you. Switch to `sse` or `pip install -U mcp` (staying below `2.0.0`).
